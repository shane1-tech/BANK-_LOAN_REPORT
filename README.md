## 📋 Review  
1. Use `SQL/schema_creation.sql` to create tables and load data.  
2. Run `SQL/data_transformation_queries.sql` to prepare clean dataset.  
3. Open `PowerBI/Bank_Loan_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the report.  
4. Look in `PowerBI/Screenshots/` for static views if you don’t have Power BI installed.
