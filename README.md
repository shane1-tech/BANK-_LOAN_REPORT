# Bank- Loan analysis 
## project overview

In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

### Data source
The primary dataset for this analysis is financial_loan.csv file, containing deeper information about bank loan

#### Tools
- Excel -data cleaning
